# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Disease-Grading-Deep-Learning-Model
The purpose of this deep learning model is to predict the risk of diabetic retinopathy from low severity 0 to high severity 4 from the retinal image.

1. Implemented in python programming language.

2. Extracted features using pretrained model VGG16.

3. Trained using random forest algorithm.

4. Used random oversampling technique to handle imbalanced diabetic risk levels.

5. Evaluated the performance with the help of confusion metric,precision,recall and f1 score.
